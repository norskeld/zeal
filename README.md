Statically-typed programming language embracing Rust-inspired single ownership model.

## Status

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a hobby project where I focus on learning Rust, parsing, type systems, semantic analysis, bytecode interpreting, concurrency/IO models, and other related topics.

Just started working on it. Anticipated features:

- Syntax inspired by Rust and Scala.
- Single ownership model, inspired by Rust, but less restrictive.
- Automatic memory management, without garbage collection.
- Static typing, with local type inference.
- Bytecode VM, either stack or register based.
- Concurrency on top of green threads, something Go/Elixir-like.
